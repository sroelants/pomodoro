# pomodoro_dev
  A javascript driven Pomodoro timer made as an assignment for [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com).

  The functionality was written in Coffeescript. I'm planning to do a rewrite in
  Purescript + Pux, since I've been dying to try something in it.


Final result can be seen [here](https://sroelants.github.io/Pomodoro).
